				<h2>So, what's with the fridge?</h2>

				<p>When I was a kid I randomly received three identical t-shirts, each green with the outline of a vintage refrigerator. I have no idea why they existed, just that they did and I loved them. We&nbsp;were inseparable, until they fell apart.</p>
				<p>I miss them.</p>
